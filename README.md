SwachhMitra tackles India's waste crisis with an AI-powered smart bin that auto-sorts waste (wet, dry, plastic). A website gamifies disposal, rewarding users with 'Green Points'. IoT sensors in bins report fill levels to a dashboard, enabling AI-driven dynamic route optimization for trucks. This saves fuel, cuts costs, and promotes a cleaner city.
